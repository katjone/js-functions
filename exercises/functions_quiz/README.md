# Quiz: Javascript For and Functions

#### Directions

* Follow the instructions in the files problem-1.js through problem-6.js.  Each question is in a separate file to make it possible for you to answer the questions and test your results independently of any work you may have done on other questions.

* You have 30 minutes. 

* There are six questions on this quiz.  Because of this, if you find yourself taking more than five minutes on a problem, the wisest strategy is to leave it and come back to it.

* Remember that you can use `jshint` to check the syntax and style of your code.
