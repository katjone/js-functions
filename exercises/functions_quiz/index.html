    The Chrome Inspector really likes to see Javascript
    files in the context of a webpage, and since it's so
    helpful we give it what it wants.

    The one disadvantage is that all Javascript source files
    are in the same global scope.  This means that screwing
    things up in one file may cause mysterious behavior in
    another.  So as a preemptive defense we comment out all
    of the script file includes that we are not working on.
