We're working on the final phase of the localiztion project: English plurals.index.html

Our job is to write the function that pluralizes a noun phrase.

We will get a number, a noun, and a function that will correctly pluralize the word passed to it

We have to construct the correct noun phrase from it, pluralizing except when the number is 1.

For instance:
  0 cats
  1 house
  2 dogs
  3 fish
  4 oxen
  5 children
